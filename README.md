[Hexapawn]
    This is a game of wit where you will be battling against a computer capable of learning every move you make, making it potentially undefeatable and unstoppable as the game progresses by.
    
    
Hexapawn is a simple console application written purely in C# .Net and is the digital equivalent of the paper game called ‘hexapawn’ which is played on a 3x3 board. It was designed to create an Artificial Intelligence that uses the same algorithm we humans used to survive and evolve (Survival of the Fittest / Natural Selection) all from scratch.  
Inspired by VSauce 2’s “The game that learns” Youtube video, this application is able to record every move a user would make (and save it on a text file), make a random valid move as a response to that move, mark the event as either good or a bad based on the outcome of the current round and makes a decision in the next round on what move to make based on its mistakes. 


     By playing this game, you agree to never blame me when AIs takes over our race and eventually lead our fate to the destruction of our very own civilization (LOL)
Proceed with caution. Please!!! (LOL)


    => This is my very first project published on Github, I’m all open for criticism and always has a room for improvement for you guys out there
    => The code is messy and will surely give developers a headache


Disclaimer: I don’t use complex methods and algorithms from your classical Machine Learning Books. I don’t study those as of now so either you let me call this project as an AI or just mind your own business. This program is capable of learning after all.
